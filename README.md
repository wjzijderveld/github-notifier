Github notifier
===============

This tool is at the moment quickly hacked to notify me when certain repositories are getting a new tag.

In the future this should be made more userfriendly, and might be transformed in a free service so you don't have to host this yourself.

NOTE: At this moment everything still needs a big refactor and cleanup, just wanted it to work for me :)
And biggest issue at the moment is rate limit of 60 an hour...
